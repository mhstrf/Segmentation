Having the Augmented Partial Factorization (APF), we minimize computational costs, especially memory consumptions, for full characterization of centimeter-scale metasurfaces.

Anugented Partial Factorization (APF) is an efficient method to fully charaterize the scattering matrix of linear complex media such as metasurfaces.
