Having the Augmented Partial Factorization (APF), we minimize computational costs, especially memory consumptions, for full characterization of centimeter-scale metasurfaces.

Anugented Partial Factorization (APF) is an efficient method to fully charaterize the scattering matrix of linear complex media with multiple input channels such as metasurfaces. APF has been published in [Nature Computations](https://www-nature-com.libproxy2.usc.edu/articles/s43588-022-00370-6), where the corresponding codes to evaluate it are available
